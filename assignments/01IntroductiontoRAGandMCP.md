# Assignment 1: Comparative Study of RAG and MCP

## Objective

Conduct a comparative analysis of RAG and MCP and demonstrate basic implementations.

## Expected Capabilities

- Understand RAG and MCP mechanisms
- Perform a basic RAG implementation
- Conduct MCP logic formulation

## Instructions

### Part 1

**Document Retrieval and Generation using RAG**

Implement a simple RAG model using a retrieval method and a text generator to respond to a query.

```
# Simplified RAG-like approach code
retriever = SimpleRetriever()
generator = SimpleGenerator()
documents = retriever.retrieve(query)
response = generator.generate(documents)
```

### Part 2

**Multiple-Choice Question Design with MCP**

Create a model or algorithm that generates multiple-choice questions based on a given context.

```
# Basic MCP-like algorithm
questions = generate_questions(context)
choices = formulate_choices(questions)
evaluate(choices)
```

## Tasks

### Task 1: Document RAG Application

Write a report comparing a simple retrieval-alleged generation model with traditional generation in terms of data relevance and output quality.

```
N/A
```

## Submission Instructions

Submit a document detailing your findings and implementations, including any code snippets.
